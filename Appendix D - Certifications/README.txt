// Pre-Script Level 1 Biomechanics & Resistance Training 

  “How muscles behave when they move from origin to insertion”

  Organises the regions of shoulder, hip and spine in order to create a workable biomechanical model of the human body.

    Explores:
        Taxonomy based on morphology and pathology
        Inter-relationship of internal structural stability and internal functional stability 
        Ordered assessment-intervention by varying ranges of motion (mobility) and external stability
        Advanced resistance training principles predicated on muscle action and function 
        Injury prevention by examining force mechanics and resistance profiles
        Muscle innervation in skill vs. output training methods 


// Pre-Script Level 2 Coaching Certification 

    "How bodies behave when we walk and breathe" 

    Builds on PSL1 model of shoulder, hip and spine by layering movement systems guided by ribcage, pelvis and nervous system. 
    
      Explores:
        Models of ventilation mechanics, gait-cycle mechanics and neurological processes to frame and solve movement problems
        Implications of anatomical variations and how structure indicates function  
        Inter-relationship of ribcage, diaphram and external musculature 
        Stance and swing phases in human locomotion 
        Lifting parameters and loading postions in driving stimulus
        Nervous System Taxonomy 
        Kinesthetic awarenesss through Cerebellum structure and function
        Skill acquisition and pain management 
        Training systems
