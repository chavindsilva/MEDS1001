" To visualise interrelationships and tensions between soft skills, technical skills, 
and the enabling role of technology within the evolving fields of sports medicine and orthopaedics "


// Figure 1 - Future Digital Health Applications 

  # Adapted from Abernethy et al. (2022), originally published by the National Academy of Medicine (2019).

    Using the diagram from source, and layering with my research in sports medicine and orthopaedics,
    a normative graph was created highlighting the impact of emerging digital technology on the respective 
    fields. The size of the plots corresponds to the scope of each advancement while the gradient corresponds to 
    perceived impact. The height relates to modility of findings, greater height = more corroborated sources.  

      highlights; diagnostics, imaging, surgical and personal therapeutics are the main overlaps and important changes


// Figure 2 - Skills 

    Outlines the relevant skills for sports medicine both current(2025) and future(2035).
    It futher dissects into technical and soft skills, on each end of the vertical axis, while a required level
    was established to reflect perceived industry standards. 
    The chart is a personal reflection of my current attributes and skills in these areas.

      highlights; in technical, knowledge of MSK structure and function (*), functional assessments (*), 3D design 
                  in soft, adaptibility in technologies, workflows and digital platforms


// Figure 3 - Aquisition 

    Visually synthesising a volumetric model from Figure 1 and Figure 2.
      Depicting acquisition as a function of f(required skills - current skills) by linking endpoints to form a membrane; technical skills x-axis, soft skills y-axis
      Overlayed with the intersecting fields and technological impact f(SportsMed n Ortho) = max(Modality) by linear curve of heights; z-axis 
      A volumetric shape was generated to underscore tensions in aquiring new skills for industry, challenged by advacements in technology. 

    Conceptual Model 
        highlights; intergration of technical skills in these fields with technology; blending of green and red moving from 2025 to 2035
                    importance of developing and integrating new types of soft skills in the future; overlapping high modal dark blue towards 2035
